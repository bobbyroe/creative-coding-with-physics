# Three.js + Rapier Physics + Creative Coding = ðŸ˜Ž

A fun physical simulation using Three.js and Rapier. Watch as code transforms into flowing, bouncing, and colliding shapesâ€”driven by motion and energy. Perfect for anyone exploring Three.js, generative art and similations.

âœ¨ What Youâ€™ll Learn:

Integrating Rapier for physics-based interactions

Building a custom mouse-driven controller to move and smack aroung a grid of boxes in real-time

Bonus: how to debug your physics simulation with Points!

Another fun and surprisingly powerful effect to add to your toolkit.
